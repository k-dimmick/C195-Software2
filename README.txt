Directions: After starting the program, log in with the applicable username and login (Usernames: test or admin; with
passwords being the same). From there, the program is relatively intuitive; it opens to a display of all appointments
that have been scheduled thus far. The user is able to select a radio button for sorted appointments within the same
calendar month, or within the next 7 days.

This program has 7 main screens: all appointments, add appointment, modify appointment, reports, all customers,
add customer, and modify customer.

The all appointment and all customer screens are accessible from all screens within the program (after login).
Reports are accessible from the all customer and all appointment screens. The add and modify appointment and customer
screens are only accessible from their applicable "all" screen (i.e. modify customer is only available from all
customers).

From either the appointments or customers screen, the user (after selecting the appropriate button) create a new
instance of either, modify an existing instance, or delete an existing instance. There are confirmation alerts in place
to confirm that only the correct instance is deleted.

The user may select "View Reports" which will take them to a new screen with the business's requested reports. The
reports - at this time - are not user specific (meaning any user that has logged into the system can access them).
If requested, this can be updated so that only specific users may access the reports.



Additional Report (A3f):
The additional report that was chosen was to reflect the different divisions that the business has offices currently
in, and the total number of customers that reside in those divisions. The purpose of this is to reflect where business
is most successful, and where additional marketing strategies may be required.
